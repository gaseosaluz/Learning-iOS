#  CSVRead

Development project to read the contents of a CSV File (contains gyro and accelerometer data) generated by the embedded hardware (currently an Arduino IoT 33 BP board) for the Parkinson's Wearables Project.

This project is more of a sandbox project. I originally started it as a short project where I could learn how to use Swift and SwiftUI to parse and manipulate a CSV file.  However after I accompllished this, I continued to extend the capabilities to convert the data into data that could be used by the CoreML models that will be used in the Parkinson's project. 

Once I finish developing algorithms that transform the data into MultiArrays (which is required by the CoreML models), I will stop development of this project and start a new one that is more specific to the Parkinson's project.
