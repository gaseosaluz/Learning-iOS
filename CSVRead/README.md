# CSV Read

## About this Repo

Read and parse CSV files in Swift using a SwiftUI interface. This project was originally developed as a 'playground' where I experimented with the `codableCSV. I used the library to open and parse CSV files that were generated as part the the **Wearables for Parkinson's Disease** project
