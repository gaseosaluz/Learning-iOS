# Projects

## tcactivityclassifier

Work based on sample code from the Turi Create website:

https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/activity_classifier/

This project includes the Python portion (that follows the above reference) pretty closely and a custom SwiftUI based iOS application to use the model that was generated by the Python Turi Create code contained in the `notebooks` directory.

As of 11/2/21 the SwiftUI code is not functional.

## CMucihar

SwiftUI based application.  

Refactoring and rework of `tcactivityclassifier`. Code that uses a Core ML model trained on the UCI dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions )
