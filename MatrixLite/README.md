# NOTE

This code was retrieved on 9/10/11 from https://gitlab.com/textileio/MatrixLite. THe code here has been changed from the oiriginal to fix errors and warnings that popped up as I tried to use it in Xcode 5.

Also, the instructions below for Cocoa Pods and Carthadge do not work. I did not try the Swift Package Manager. I tried to use this by simply dropping the code in my projects.

Note that there is no documentation and the examples are very poor. It is very difficult to really figure out how to use.

# A Lightweight 'Accelerated' Matrix Library for Swift

A super lightweight Accelerated Matrix Library for Swift that draws inspiration from [Surge](https://github.com/mattt/Surge).
MatrixLite aims to be the lightweight cousin of Surge, with most of what you want, and none of what you don't.

## About

`MatrixLite` is our answer to a user-friendly Matrix library that supports array striding, transposing, slicing, and various reducers and mathematical functions. Currently supports most of the methods required for basic artificial neural network (ANN) architectures and [extreme learning machines (ELM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_learning_machine).

Matrices are the workhorse of many machine learning/ANN workflows, so optimization and API simplification at the level of data representation has far-reaching implications for complex computational workflows. `MatrixLite` is designed to be fast, super lightweight, and most importantly, easy to use. Wherever possible, we take advantage of [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instructions and data types and we take advantage of Apple's [Accelerate framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate) throughout. To facilitate rapid model development and prototyping, `MatrixLite` wraps all of this computational power under a much more readable and 'Swifty' API.

## API

### Designated Initializer

```swift
Matrix(_ data: [FloatingPoint], rows: Int, columns: Int? = nil)
```

The default initializer for a `Matrix` creates an 2-dimensional array wrapping an underlying array data storage:

- Parameters:
  - `data` is a 1D array storage. It is an instance of Array.
  - `rows` is an Int specifying the number of rows of the Matrix
  - `columns` is an Int specifying the number of columns of the Matrix
- Returns: An 2-dimensional Matrix wrapping `data`.

### Other Initializers

Because we use Matrices in many different contexts, we need multiple ways to specify them:

```swift
// Create 2D matrix from an array of arrays
let data = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],
            [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0],
            [8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0],
            [4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]]
let matrix = Matrix(unpack: data)
// Create 2D Matrix of repeated values
let ones = Matrix(repeating: 1.0, rows: 4, columns: 4)
// Make a copy of an existing Matrix object
let copy = Matrix(copy: matrix)
// Create a diagonal Matrix from an input array
let diag = Matrix(diagonal: data[0])
// Row and Column Matrices are also easy to specify
let rowMatrix = Matrix(row: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
let colMatrix = Matrix(column: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
```

We also have several useful `Vector` initializers, where `Vector` is simply a type alias to a `FloatingPoint` `Array`

```swift
typealias Vector<FloatingPoint> = [FloatingPoint]

let range = Vector(from: 0.0, to: 10.0, by: 1.0)
let linspace = Vector(from: 1.0, through: 10.0, by: 1.0)

// Or to create a vector of random uniform values in [0, 1]
let random = Vector(initializedWith: drand48, count: 10)
```

### Mathematical Operations

How about matrix multiplication? Sure we got that:

```swift
let vector = Vector(initializedWith: drand48, count: 25)
let B = Matrix(vector, rows: 5, columns: 5) // Some random matrix
let A: Matrix<Double> = identity(rows: 10, columns: 5, offset: 0) // Identity matrix
let C = A * B
// or, for element-wise multiplication
let D = A[0..<5, 0..<5] Ã— B
```

We've also got a whole slew of SIMD math functions (that operate along the whole matrix):

```swift
let arange = Vector(from: 0.0, to: 10.0, by: 0.1)
let initial = Matrix(arange, rows: 20, columns: 5)
let chained = pow((5.0 * matrix) / 5.0, 2.0)
```

And even some commonly used reducers:

```swift
let total = sum(Vector(chained))
let totalByRows = apply(sum, to: chained, along: .rows)
let average = mean(Vector(chained))
```

And of course, since this is Swift, you can use things like map, flatMap, and reduce directly:

```swift
let anotherTotal = Vector(chained).reduce(0.0) { $0 + $1 }
let product = Vector(chained).reduce(1.0) { $0 * $1 }
let cube = Vector(chained).map { $0 * $0 * $0 }
let flattened = Vector(chained)
```

### Slicing and Dicing

```swift
let moreData = Vector(from: 0, to: 25, by: 1.0)
print(moreData.count)
let anotherMatrix = Matrix(moreData, rows: 5, columns: 5)
// Slice by rows and cols
print(anotherMatrix[0..<5, 0])
// Grab sub-matrices
print(anotherMatrix[0..<3, 0..<3])
print(anotherMatrix[0..<3, ...2]) // Mix and match range types
// Grab individual elements
print(anotherMatrix[0, 0])
// We can also shift and slice from the 'top' and 'bottom' directly
let hiLo = anotherMatrix[0..<3, 0..<5][...1, ...3]
print(hiLo.rows, hiLo.columns) // (2, 4)
```

## Installation

Probably the easiest and most useful method is to add `MatrixLite` a git submodule. Simply drag the `MatrixLite.xcodeproj` file into your Xcode project, and add `MatrixLite.framework` as a dependency for your target.

### Swift Package Manager

To use [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) add `MatrixLite` to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "myproject",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://gitlab.com/weareset/MatrixLite.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.0.0")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "myproject",
            dependencies: ["MatrixLite"]),
    ]
)
```

Then run `swift build`.

### CocoaPods

To use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) add `MatrixLite` to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'MatrixLite', '~> 0.1.0'
end
```

Then run `pod install`.

### Carthage

To use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) add `MatrixLite` to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "weareset/MatrixLite" ~> 0.1.0
```

Then run `carthage update` and use the framework in `Carthage/Build/<platform>`.
