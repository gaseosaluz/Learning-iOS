# Learning-iOS
Projects and code snippets in my journey to learn iOS Programming

The code in this repo comes from (in no particular order):

* Books
* On Line blogs and articles
* Personal experimentation

More details about each project inside their appropriate folder

## NOTES

* Large files such as RAW/DNG images are not part of this repo
* Machine Learning Projects that make reference to "models" do not have the model files checked in. These files are too large. If you want those models and/or cannot find them elsewhere, please contact me.

## Changes and Updates

The folder `ML-with-CoreML has been moved to a separate repository where I am collecting iOS Specific ML projects. The link for that repo is: https://github.com/gaseosaluz/ML-iOS
